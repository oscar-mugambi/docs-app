13th week of weight loss 
Coming off of a huge plateau 
Date : 27/05/23
Current Weight : 84.1
Goal weight : 78




Measurements


Belly across the belly button =>30¼




Right thigh, tiny black spot further up ahead. Not the chicken pox scar but a tiny black spot on your inside thigh => 23¾




Right arm unflexed => Just under 16 and one quarter inches 








Abs sometimes 
Nipples barely puffy (It's cold season though) 


Abs are not clearly defined and I'm still carrying a substantial amount of fat on my thighs and torso


Also considering getting to 77Kgs just so I can remain under 80Kgs after any bounce back effect after the diet
