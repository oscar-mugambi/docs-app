10th week of weight loss 
I think I should get to 78kgs. Take pics, compare with 2017 version of me at 78Kgs. Just for shits and giggles. 




Date : 13/05/23
Current Weight : 84.3
Goal weight : 82? 




Measurements


Belly across the belly button =>30¾




Chest across nips => 39   (Very rough estimate) 




Right thigh, tiny black spot further up ahead. Not the chicken pox scar but a tiny black spot on your inside thigh (seated) => 24¼




Right arm unflexed => Just under 16 and one quarter inches 








Abs sometimes 
Nipples barely puffy (It's cold season though) 
Bench went down by 1 rep for the 120kg set 


Abs are not clearly defined and I'm still carrying a substantial amount of fat on my thighs and torso


Also considering getting to 77Kgs just so I can remain under 80Kgs after any bounce back effect after the diet
